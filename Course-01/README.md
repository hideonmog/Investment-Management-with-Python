# Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python

Throughout this course we will be learning about portfolio construction and analysis whilst also developing a library containing the tools required to do this; - [EDHEC Risk Kit](https://github.com/hideonmog/Investment-Management-with-Python/blob/main/Course-01/edhec_risk_kit.py).

Below are my notes and lab session work contained in jupyter notebooks, named by content covered and in chronological order.
