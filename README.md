# Investment Management with Python

This repo contains my lab session notebooks and other work whilst completing the Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning Specialisation on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning), given by the EDHEC Business School.

I am taking this course to further my knowledge of finance whilst also increasing my proficiency in data analysis.
